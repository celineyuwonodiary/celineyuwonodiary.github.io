## A Bit About Me


Hi!<br/>

My name is Celine Yuwono. I am from Jakarta, Indonesia.
I graduated from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill majoring in BS Information Sciences.
Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer at Agile Media Network Co.Ltd,
a company in Tokyo, Japan focusing on Ambassador Marketing.<br/>

## Why I Started this Site
1. I tend to forget what I have learned easily, so this website is like my notebook.
2. I learn and organize things better when typing it out.
3. Presenting it 
Instead of just taking notes on my computer, I prefer to do it in a blog format because then, I can review what I have learned easier.
