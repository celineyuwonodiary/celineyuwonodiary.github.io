## A Bit About Me

Hi!<br/>

My name is Celine Yuwono. I am from Jakarta, Indonesia.
I graduated from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill majoring in BS Information Sciences.
Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer at Agile Media Network Co.Ltd,
a company in Tokyo, Japan focusing on Ambassador Marketing.<br/>

## Why I Started this Site

I forget what I learn easily, so this website is like my notebook.
The reason why it is a website is because it gives me motivation to study more and
I do not have to worry about losing my notes!
