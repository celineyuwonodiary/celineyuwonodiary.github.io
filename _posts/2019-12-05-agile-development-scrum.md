In traditional software development, a team follows through the traditional SDLC starting from planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, implementation, and maintenance within a longer period of time.

The Agile Methodology is basically iterative development meaning that instead of taking up a year or so and following a full SDLC cycle, a team follows through a certain framework to develop features or programs within a short period of time called a sprint. A new sprint begins once the previous one ends and the resulting product of each sprint are finished, usable features.

While the traditional software development methodology focuses on the end product, agile methodology breaks down the end product into independent features and develop those in iterations. This allows for a change in course in development if the product specification changes allowing better accomodation of the customer's needs, hence the term 'agile'. In the agile methodology, the team focuses on results.

### A Framework of Agile: Scrum

Remember that agile is only a methodology, or a way of thinking. There are multiple frameworks that has structure and rules to developing a software the agile method. One of it is called the Scrum.

**Three Types of Roles**

- **Product Owner**: The Product Owner gets input from the customers and knows the big picture of what the product should be. They are responsible in defining the end goal and the tasks that needs to be completed to the rest of the team. The Product Owner creates the backlog of to-do list items and reviews deliverables before the product is delivered.

- **Scrum Master:** The scrum master can be said to be the project manager. They oversee day-to-day functions and check-in with the members of the development team. They are reponsible for the tasks to be delivered on time and the team's wellbeing.

- **Team Member:** Team members are engineers, copywriters, designers, and so on of the development team. They focus on developing high quality products.

**Common Types of Meetings in a Scrum**

1. **Daily Scrum:** Scrum master and development team report what they did, what they are going to do, or difficulties daily in a short meeting. The meeting should be light and ideally be no longer than 15 minutes.
2. **Sprint Planning:** This is one big meeting at the end of each sprint where finished products are reviewed, and new tasks are divided marking the beginning of the next sprint. The product owner needs to prepare which tasks in the backlog to prioritize and define the requirements to the scrum master and development team in order for the right amount of tasks to be divided properly. This meeting should last no more than 4 hours for a 2 week sprint.
3. **Sprint Review:** The meeting where the development team presents to the product manager and scrum master what they did during the sprint. In the case of multiple teams in a project, a representative of the team can present. It shuold last for 2 hours for a 2 week sprint.
4. **Sprint Retrospective:** A meeting consisting of the scrum master and development team to reflect on the previous sprint and what each member of the team felt they did well, difficulties along the way, and what could be done for improvement. The meeting should last between 1-2 hours for a 2 week sprint.
5. **Backlog Refining:** In this meeting, members of the development team estimates how long to finish a task in the backlog so the product owner can decide on which task to prioritize in each sprint.

### The Key to Making Agile Development Work

- Each role of the agile development must be defined so that everyone understands what is expected of them and deliver those expectations.
- Product requirements must be clearly determined so that each member of the development team knows what they are responsible of, allowing flexible work but the task still finished on time.
- Meetings are important but never go over the necessary meeting time. It is important to know the goal and takeaway of every meeting.
