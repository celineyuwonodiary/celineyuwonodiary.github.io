### Purpose vs Calling

**Purpose**: Your purpose is the reason you are created. The only way to know why you are created is to ask the creator. Everyone has a unique purpose. Examples include teaching the gospel, building infrastructure in remote areas, or establishing a health-care business to promote healthy living. The end goal is ultimately to make disciples of Christ.

> _The human body has many parts, but the many parts make up one whole body. So it is with the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:12)_.

**Calling**: Your calling is when God tells you to do something specific in a certain period of time. God may call you to go Med School or write a book. A calling is not an end goal, but it is what builds your character that leads you to fulfiling your purpose. We may share the same calling, but our purpose will be different.

When you are obedient to God and follow what God calls you to do, you will be walking in your purpose and in there you will truly realize and live out your passion.

> _And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose (Romans 8:28)._

### Three Types of Calling

1. **The General Call**: This is God's first call to us to become Christians.

2. **The Call of Marriage**: Marriage is when God joins two people in covenant. This is a special type of calling because when you are called to take a job, you can change jobs, but when you marry, your are bound to it until death.

3. **The Continuous Calling**: This calling is a process consisting of multiple callings where in each step, God leads you into positions of service in order for you to grow. These positions of service can be in Church or in the Marketplace.

### Finding Your Calling

> _Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart (Psalms 37:4)._

Are you being obedient to God? Your can check if your calling is from God and if it is where God wants you to be by going through the 6 questions below.

1. What kinds of services are good and beneficial?
2. What are the true needs of the world?
3. What has God gifted me to be fruitful at?
4. What are the counsel I receive from godly people?
5. Am I covering all of this in constant prayer for ?
6. What are my recurring, strong, holy desires?

### Bible Verse of the Day

> _Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age (Matthew 28:19-20)._

We must imitate Christ and set an example of what it is like to live in God, in order to gather disciples of Christianity.
